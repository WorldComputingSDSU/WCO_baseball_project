# Project Structure Guide

This document explains how the Baseball Data Platform is organized for team collaboration.

## Overview

```
WCO_baseball_project/
├── frontend/              # My completed work
├── backend/               # To be created by backend team
├── README.md              # Main project documentation
├── STRUCTURE.md           # This file
└── .gitignore             # Git ignore rules
```

## Current Organization (CORRECT)

### Frontend Work
Everything is built in the `frontend/` folder:

```
frontend/
├── src/
│   ├── app/           # All pages
│   └── components/    # All components
├── public/            # Images and static files
├── package.json       # Dependencies
├── README.md          # Frontend documentation
└── ...config files    # Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind
```


## Future Organization (When Backend Joins)

### Backend Team (Later)
They'll create a parallel folder:

```
backend/
├── src/
│   ├── routes/        # API endpoints
│   ├── controllers/   # Business logic
│   └── models/        # Data models
├── package.json       # Backend dependencies
├── README.md          # Backend documentation
└── ...config files    # Express, database, etc.
```

## How to Push to GitHub

### For Frontend Work (Now)

```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
cd WCO_baseball_project
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial frontend implementation"

# Add remote repository
git remote add origin GITHUB_URL

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### What Gets Pushed
- `frontend/` folder with all the code  
- `README.md` explaining the project  
- `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files  

**Excluded:**
- `node_modules/` (excluded by .gitignore)  
- `.next/` build files (excluded by .gitignore)  
- `.env` files (excluded by .gitignore)  

## Team Workflow

### Phase 1: Frontend Only (Current)
```
WCO_baseball_project/
└── frontend/          ← Only this exists
    └── (all the code)
```

**Action**: Push this to GitHub. The team can see and work on frontend.

### Phase 2: Backend Added (Future)
```
WCO_baseball_project/
├── frontend/          ← Frontend code (unchanged)
└── backend/           ← New folder by backend team
```

**Action**: Backend team adds their folder alongside frontend. No conflicts!

## Benefits of This Structure

### Clear Separation
- Frontend work is in `frontend/`
- Backend team works in `backend/`
- No file conflicts!

### Independent Development
- Frontend can deploy to Vercel immediately
- Backend can develop at their own pace
- Both teams can work in parallel

### Easy Collaboration
- Each folder has its own `package.json`
- Each folder has its own dependencies
- Each folder has its own README
- Teams can work without stepping on each other

### Professional Organization
- Industry-standard monorepo approach
- Easy for new team members to understand
- Clear ownership of code

## Checklist for Pushing

Before pushing to GitHub, verify:

- All code is in `frontend/` folder
- `.gitignore` exists at root
- `README.md` exists at root
- Frontend works locally (`npm run dev`)
- No `node_modules/` or `.next/` in git
- No sensitive data or `.env` files

## For New Team Members

### Frontend Developers
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone REPO_URL

# Go to frontend
cd WCO_baseball_project/frontend

# Install and run
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Backend Developers (When Ready)
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone REPO_URL

# Create backend folder
cd WCO_baseball_project
mkdir backend
cd backend

# Set up backend
npm init
# ... backend setup
```

## Key Takeaway

**This structure is perfect for team collaboration!**

- All frontend code is organized in one folder
- Backend team has clear space for their work
- No confusion about what goes where
- Easy to deploy frontend immediately
- Clean separation of concerns

**Ready to push with confidence!**
